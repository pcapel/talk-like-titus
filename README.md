Titus is the best worst dog

## Rules
1. Every paragraph begins and ends with a string of random flourish characters,
   like `~*()(~**~ ~~` like sparkles
2. Randomized capitalization throughout
3. Periods become random emojis

## Rationale
A fun way to play with writing a Julia CLI. Why not?

## TODO 
- Generalize the selection of weights for an array of items select an element
  from an array. Currently I am just populating the array with the number of
  values equivalent to the weight that I want the value to have, but that's not
  nearly elegant enough. There's probably a function written for this already.
